<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Why a <span class="smcap">Council</span> of <span class="smcap">Dogs</span> was convened on the Plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The <span class="smcap">President Sheep Dog</span> thus rose to explain.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"This meeting I call, to complain of misusage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the poets, who now a days have a strange usage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of leading up Insects and Birds to Parnassus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, without rhyme or reason, unnotic'd they pass us.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Declare then those talents by which we may claim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some pretensions, I hope, to poetical fame.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I</i> boast of whole legions, my voice who obey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without me the Sheep, e'en the Shepherd, might stray&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But no more of myself&mdash;Let each Dog of spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stand forward and modestly state his own merit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I charge you be gentle, let's hear of no growling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No grinning, no snarling, no snapping, no howling."<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
<span class="i2">The <span class="smcap">Greyhound</span> first rose, with a spring from his seat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarcely bending the grass, that grew under his feet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His figure was airy, and placid his mien;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet to flash in his eye indignation was seen.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Brave companions," said he, "shall <i>we</i> noble beasts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear of <i>Butterflies Balls</i> and <i>Grasshoppers Feasts</i>?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear dinned in our ears, wherever we roam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The <i>Mask seeing Lion</i> and <i>Peacock at Home</i>?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall we hear all this, nor assert the fair fame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That for ages long past has distinguished our name?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forbid it ye Dogs!&mdash;here behold me stand forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To proclaim to the world my deserts, and my worth!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keen and swift in the chace, I can boldly declare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From my speed, as I follow, in vain flies the Hare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, while like the wind, I bound over the course<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My master comes lagging behind on his Horse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twixt friends, I could laugh, at beholding the fuss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And boasting men make of success due to us;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The truth is so obvious 'tis scarce worth enforcing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without our assistance they could not go coursing."<br /></span>

<span class="caption">&quot;Then the hound &amp; the Grey-hound both flew at the poodle&quot;</span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"All you say," quoth the <span class="smcap">Harrier</span>, "dear coz, is most true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I think it but just, to give each Dog his due;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So don't be offended if <i>I</i> dare disclose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That <i>you</i> are not gifted, like me, with a nose."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When the <span class="smcap">Poodle</span> heard this, he laugh'd out aloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the Curs grinned, who were mixed in the crowd:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the Hound and the Grey-hound both flew at the Poodle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And called him a curl-coated Cur, and a noodle&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor Poodle was frighten'd at what he had done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But being himself much addicted to fun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And having no notion of running by scent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He could not conceive the Hound seriously meant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To say, that the Grey-hound had no nose at all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he'd one twice as long as his own, tho' 'twas small.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Come have done with your jaw," said the <span class="smcap">Fox-hound</span> in spleen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For how should a foreigner know what you mean?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May-hap he can dance, and I'm sure he can beg;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him run me a race, and I'll tye up a leg;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in hunting, in truth, the <span class="smcap">Harrier</span> and <span class="smcap">Beagle</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more equal us, than the Hawk does the Eagle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trotting after a Hare is mere childish play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It may now and then serve, to kill a dull day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But <i>we</i>, at sun rise, seek the Fox in the cover,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drive him often before us, ten counties half over;</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweep wild o'er the hill, or close at his brush<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unchecked thro' the gorse, and the river we rush,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Ph&#339;bus once more must sink down to his nest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'er we slacken our chace, or betake us to rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So tempting our sport, Men think it atones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the maiming of limbs and the breaking of bones."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Said the <span class="smcap">Stag-hound</span>&mdash;"All rivalships here I disclaim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since for strength, and for speed, so well known is my fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I justly am reckon'd the first amongst hounds:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet our chace like the <span class="smcap">Fox-hounds</span>, with danger abounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, is sometimes attended with fatal effects,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in hunting of Stags, men <i>have</i> broken their necks."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Oh pray say no more," said a poor <span class="smcap">meagre cur</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"It grieves me to think men such dangers incur;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mankind, I'm a friend of the genuine breed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A friend little known, but in th' hour of need;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By this string round my neck I guide my poor master,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And true to his touch, I go slower or faster;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh Pity his sorrows, for he is stone blind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And without my assistance his way could not find;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I lead him with caution through Alleys and Streets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rejoice to observe the relief that he meets:<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And when to our lodging at night we repair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the food he's collected, he gives me a share."<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Then a <span class="smcap">Spaniel</span> advanced, with a courtier-like mien,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His manners were gentle, his coat soft, and clean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His nose was jet black, and his ears were so long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They swept on the ground, as he passed through the throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus he spoke&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"We boast to mankind an attachment so pure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That docile, and patient, their blows we endure:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We can hunt, we can quest, and what's more we can trace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A descent long ennobled by favour and grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For our ancestors portraits are still to be seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With those of the <i>Babes</i> of <i>King Charles</i> and his <i>Queen</i>."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"You boast of your rank, Sir," the <span class="smcap">Water-dog</span> cried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he shook his rough coat, that was scarcely yet dried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"But in sport who with me can compare?&mdash;have you seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the bush-fringed pool is mantled with green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How I wind, thro' the reeds and the rushes, my way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the haunt of the Snipe, or the Mallard betray?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How, when loud sounds the Gun, aroused by the crash&nbsp;}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(As the fall of the victim, is marked by the splash)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   }<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaping forward I bear off the prey at a dash?"  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      }<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
<span class="i2">"Tis enough&mdash;you have merit&mdash;but I think it better<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mention my claims," quoth the feather-tailed <span class="smcap">Setter</span>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The dew of the morn I with rapture inhale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When check'd in my course, by the scent breathing gale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In caution low crouching each gesture displays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the covey lies basking, or sportively plays;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My net bearing master I watch as I creep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till encircled, the brood is enthralled at a sweep."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The <span class="smcap">Pointer</span> then rose, and observ'd&mdash;"Sir, your trade is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So gentle and quiet, it might suit the ladies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor things who would scream at the sound of a gun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which we <span class="smcap">Pointers</span> consider as part of the fun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We range the wide fallows, or quarter the stubble,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the labouring sportsman, alive to each double,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hails the high stiffen'd tail, and the motionless joint,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cautiously warns the whole field of the point;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As by magic transfixt, all the signal obey&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the death dealing tube, he hastes up to his prey."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the Pointer a bandy leg'd <span class="smcap">Turnspit</span> replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"All you've said, worthy kinsman, cannot be denied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As to pastimes and sports&mdash;but allow <i>me</i> to say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I to men some good turns have done in my day.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
<span class="i0">When the sportsman returns to his meal, what avail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your ranging, and pointing, and high stiffen'd tail?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of your posture so graceful, good Sir, you may boast it;<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a><br /></span>

<span class="i2">A bristly Scotch <span class="smcap">Terrier</span>, his eyes black and keen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus attack'd the last speaker&mdash;"Pray what do you mean?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To boast of your service no longer of use;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you still roasted meat, there <i>might</i> be some excuse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Smoak-jacks, and Rumfords, and other new hits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ease you (thank the Dog Star) from turning of spits.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to be in such haste to record your own worth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And speak before me, a famed dog of the North,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who all vermine destroy, Mouse, Weazle, or Rat!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Says the Turnspit&mdash;"why so can my mistress's Cat."&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"You crooked leg'd Cur," said the <span class="smcap">Terrier</span>, "to dare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such talents as mine, with a Cat's to compare"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The <span class="smcap">President Sheep-dog</span> to order now call'd 'em,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He threaten'd the meeting should instantly close&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here the <span class="smcap">Pug</span> and the <span class="smcap">Spaniard</span>, each turn'd up his nose.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
<span class="i2">But a dapper <span class="smcap">Barbet</span>, so blithe and so smart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his ruffles, and ruff, all shorn with such art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tript forward, and said his tricks he would play&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He tumbled,&mdash;fetch'd ball,&mdash;and down for dead lay,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then started alive to defend GEORGE THE THIRD,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, in pleasure loud barking, their plaudits were heard.<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><span class="smcap">Eight curs</span>, thus encouraged, stepp'd out with delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And suddenly rear'd on their hind legs upright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They bow'd, and they curtsey'd with infinite skill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And danced on the turf a graceful quadrille.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">More <span class="smcap">Mongrels</span> rush forward, all eager to tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How their masters they serve, and in what they excel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each follow'd or Pedlar, or Tinker, or Gipsy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And watch'd o'er the goods, while their masters got <a name="tipsy" id="tipsy"></a>tipsy.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The <span class="smcap">Poacher's-dog</span> trembling, and all in a fright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then whisper'd, <i>he</i> follow'd his master by night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>He</i> never gave tongue, he safely could say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not telling tales, slunk slyly away.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Stop a moment, dear Sir, and look not so rueful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But hearken to me who'm the Dog for a Truffle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though your body be thin, and your spirits be low,<br /></span>

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project

and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
